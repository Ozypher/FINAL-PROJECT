Youve download BulletQuake!

My final project for Lord Kehoe

My requirements were:

10 weapon edits (I think youll find they are all aparrent)
Enemies that shoot slow moving high fire rate projectiles in patters (You can also see those)
A Scorestreak/combo system (Every 2 kills you get a reward!)
5 Powerups that would help (I made these part of the scorestreak!)

You can check the score by pressing F1 and looking below the help menu.

To install just install the repo, place the repo in your quake 2 folder, and redirrect your shortcut to it!

Have fun, and PLEASE grade kindly, this semmester has been rough.
